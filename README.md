# AP-CS-A
This a repository of all the work I did while my Study of AP CS A in Hisar Highschool. 
Well I have written code and taken part or led projects in the past I have never published them. Now that I changed my school and in relation my envoierment;
I have decided to get new usefull habits like publishing my work to the world. I thought there was not a better way to start then publishing my work that I produce during my Study of AP Cs A in Hisar Highschool
This repository is not a complete project rather a storage of examples of basics in java that are covered in AP CS A ciriculum(2023). 
I hope this repository proves it self helpfull to people who are trying to find resoures during their study of CS basics or just trying to get into coding.
Thank you for your interest and keep coding ðŸ˜Ž
