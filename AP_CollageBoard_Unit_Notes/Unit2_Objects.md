## Objects and Classes:

`Class: `

a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects. For example, you can have a Student class to represent students in a school.

`Object:`

 An object is an instance of a class. Objects represent real-world entities and have attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods). For instance, an instance of the Student class represents a specific student with attributes like name and age.

`Fields:`

Fields are variables declared within a class to store data specific to an object. These are also known as instance variables because each object has its own set of field values. For example, in a Circle class, you might have a field called radius to store the radius of a circle object.

`Methods:`

Methods are functions defined within a class. They represent the behaviors or actions that objects of the class can perform. For example, a Rectangle class might have methods like calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter().
Constructors:

`Constructors` are special methods used to create and initialize objects. They have the same name as the class and are called when you create a new object. Constructors allow you to set initial values for the object's fields. For example, you can have a Student class constructor that takes a student's name and age as parameters to initialize those fields when a new student object is created.
Instantiation:

`Instantiation` is the process of creating an object from a class. You use the new keyword followed by the class name and parentheses to create an instance of a class. For instance, Student myStudent = new Student(); creates a new Student object and assigns it to the variable myStudent.
Accessing Object Members:

You can access an object's fields and methods using the dot notation. For example, if you have a Person object named person, you can access its fields like person.name and call its methods like person.sayHello().
Encapsulation:

`Encapsulation` is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming. It refers to the practice of bundling data (fields) and methods that operate on that data within a class. It helps in hiding the internal details of how a class works and provides a clean interface for interacting with objects.
Inheritance (Briefly Mentioned):

`Inheritance` allows you to create new classes that are based on existing classes. It enables code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. While Unit 2 might introduce basic inheritance concepts, a more in-depth exploration usually occurs in later units.
