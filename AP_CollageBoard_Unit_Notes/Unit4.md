# Loops:

Loops are control structures used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. Java provides several types of loops, including for, while, and do-while.

## for Loop:

The for loop is used when you know the exact number of times you want to execute a block of code. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and iteration. For example:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // Code to be repeated
}

## while Loop:

The while loop is used when you want to execute a block of code while a certain condition is true. The condition is checked before each iteration. For example:

while (condition) {
    // Code to be repeated
}

## do-while Loop:

The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block is executed at least once because the condition is checked after the code block. For example:

do {
    // Code to be repeated
} while (condition);

## break and continue Statements:

break is used to exit a loop prematurely, typically when a certain condition is met.
continue is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and continue to the next iteration of the loop.

## Nested Loops:

You can have loops inside other loops. This is known as nested loops. Nested loops are useful for solving problems that involve multiple levels of repetition.

## Loop Control Variables:

Loop control variables are variables used to control the behavior of a loop. They are often used in conditions to determine when a loop should stop.

## Infinite Loops:

An infinite loop is a loop that never terminates because its condition is always true. Infinite loops are usually errors and should be avoided.

## Common Loop Patterns:

Loops are used to perform a wide range of tasks, such as iterating through arrays, processing input, and generating sequences of numbers. Understanding common loop patterns is crucial for solving programming problems efficiently.

## Looping with Arrays:

Loops are frequently used to iterate through arrays and perform operations on each element. You can use for or while loops to traverse arrays.

## Looping for Input Validation:

Loops are often used to validate user input. A common pattern is to use a loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until valid data is provided.

## Loop Design and Optimization:

Writing efficient and well-structured loops is an important skill. Considerations include loop initialization, boundary conditions, and minimizing unnecessary work.
